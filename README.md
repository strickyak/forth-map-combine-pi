# Estimating Pi (in Forth for 2020-10-24 SVFIG)

* A simple Forth [compiler](blob/main/compiler.py).
* A simple C++ [run](blob/main/runtime.h)[time](blob/main/runtime.cc).
* A simple Monte Carlo [simulation](blob/main/pi.4th) in the above Forth for estimating pi.

## See http://wiki.yak.net/1149

The [interpreted subdirectory](interpreted/)
contains an experimental Forth interpreter
that I tried first, but was too slow.
But I still kinda like it.
