# Estimating Pi (in Forth for 2020-10-24 SVFIG)

* A simple Forth compiler.
* A simple Forth runtime.
* A simple Monte Carlo simulation in the above Forth for estimating pi.

## See http://wiki.yak.net/1149

The (interpreted subdirectory)[interpreted/]
contains an experimental Forth interpreter
that I tried first, but was too slow.
But I still kinda like it.
